Adds keyboard shortcuts to stepwise reshape the window grid, that is, resize the active or all windows from the center axes depending of their position:[list]
[*] shift rightwards:[list]
  [*] windows at the left screen edge: grow to right
  [*] windows at the right screen edge: shrink from left
  [*] windows in the middle: move right[/list]
[*] analogous for leftwards/upwards/downwards.[/list]

Whether to resize only the active or all adjacent windows, all or unminimized windows, as well as the step sizes and the keyboard shortcuts are configurable.
